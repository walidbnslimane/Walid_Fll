            <h2>Why FIRST LEGO League?</h2>
            <p>
                I want to participate in the FIRST LEGO League because it offers a unique opportunity to 
                apply my skills in problem-solving, creativity, and robotics while collaborating with others 
                who share my passion. The competition challenges inspire me to think critically and push 
                the boundaries of innovation.
            </p>
            <p>
                By joining FLL, I aim to enhance my technical knowledge, contribute to my team's success, 
                and promote STEM values in my community.
